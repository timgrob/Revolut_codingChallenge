# dataChallenge
This code base is based on an interview coding challenge. The challenge included three tasks: 
* Build an ETL module to retrieve data from .CSV files and store them in a postgresSQL database according to their database schemata. 
* Write a query to find users, whose first transaction was above 10 USD
* Write an algorithm to detect fraudsters

# Data 
The original data can be found in the data folder. This folder also contains another README.md file, which explains the database schemata which are used.
