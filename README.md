# dataChallenge
This code base is based on an interview coding challenge. The challenge included three tasks: 
* Build an ETL module to retrieve data from .CSV files and store them in a postgreSQL database according to their database schemata. 
* Write a query to find users, whose first transaction was above 10 USD
* Write an algorithm to detect fraudsters

# Data 
The original data can be found in the data folder. This folder also contains another README.md file, which explains the database schemata which are used.
Feel free to code your own solution to this nice data problem. 

# Run
In order to run my solution to this coding challenge. Set up a postgreSQL database and change the database parameters in the settings.py file in the config folder according to your needs. Then simply execute the main.py file.
